Below is the description on how to use PDS-GO on different hosts

     Install the IOC on any computer (to be done permanently on nuc-03)
     Start the stream device server on the computer to which PDS-GO is to be connected (python3
     /epics/base-7.0.6.1/require/4.0.0/siteMods/pdsgo2/1.1.0+0/pdsgo2-server.py). This computer
     must have python 3 installed with the following packages:
         usb.core
         usb.util
         time
         sys
         socketserver
         socket
         binascii
         struct
     Connect the dosemeter to the USB port on the computer running pdsgo2-server.py
     Set the PV ioc05-pdsgo2:asynRec.HOSTINFO to the host to which the dosemeter is connected (right
     now it's nuc-03:1140)
